            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt, That the diſcerning ſervants of God in Scripture, ſuch as have been acquainted with God, and have ſeen into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin, have bewailed this ſin with their moſt briniſh tears, and deepeſt groans, and agonies of ſpirit. It is enough to break ones heart, to read with what heart-breaking-ſighes, thoſe holy men of God, <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> have bewailed this ſin, lying in the duſt at Gods feet. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> leſſe, then our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this; ſhould we again break thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>O Lord God of Iſrael, thou art righteous, for we remain, yet eſcaped as it is this day: Behold, we are before thee in our treſpaſſes, for we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this. Nehemiah</hi> is very Patheticall in the confeſſion of this ſin, all along the ninth Chapter of that Book, weeping out this godly ſorrow, as it were with tears of blood. <hi>Daniel</hi> is covered with confuſion of face, when he bewailed this ſin of Covenant-Violation in the ninth Chapter of his Propheſie. <hi>O Lord, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of faces, Ver.</hi> 7. And again, <hi>O Lord, to me belongs confuſion of face, to our Kings, to our Princes, &amp;c. Verſ.</hi> 8. It is breach of Covenant he bewails
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125741:8"/>with ſo much confuſion of face and brokenneſſe of heart in that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Covenant-violation is a ſin,
<note n="2" place="margin">Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in and by the very Heathen.</note> highly cenſured in the very poor <hi>pur-blind, Heathen:</hi> It ſtands as an Infamy, and a Brand upon them in that Catalogue of their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Covenant-breakers:</hi> Yea, it was a ſin, that as blind as they were, they were able by the very light of nature, to diſcover in the People of God, and could give it as the <hi>accompt</hi> of that <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>diſolation</hi> which befell them, demanding of one another as they paſſed by the ruines of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jerem.</hi> 22. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It may appear to be a Quarrell of a high nature,
<note n="3" place="margin">3. The fearfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> if we conſider the grievous judgements wherewith the Lord hath threatned and avenged this ſin, as here in the text; The <hi>Sword</hi> with a black Regiment of other dreadfull judgements, following; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. <hi>I will ſend the peſtilence among you, and ye ſhall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

My Brethren, <hi>God is a God of Judgement,</hi> and doth all his works in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure. Nehemiah</hi> acknowledged it in his confeſſion, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Howbeit thou art juſt in all that is come upon us; for thou haſt done right, but we have done wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> Yea, holy <hi>Ezra</hi> hath a ſtrain higher then this, in his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9 13. <hi>Our God hath puniſhed us leſſe then our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do deſerve.</hi> Behold, theſe great and fearfull judgements, and curſes, purſuing this ſin of <hi>Covenant-violation,</hi> and yet ſo farre from <hi>exceeding,</hi> that they <hi>fall ſhort</hi> of the merit of it; <hi>Our God hath puniſhed us, leſſe then our ſins deſerved.</hi> Of what a high
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125741:9"/>nature (think ye) is this quarrell, when ſo many tall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like ſo many <hi>Anakims</hi> though ſtanding upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of another, cannot reach it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note n="4" place="margin">4 The care of Gods people after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, to make up this breach</note> It may appear from hence, in as much, as alwayes upon the recovery and deliverance of the people of God, from their Captivity, and other Judgements: you ſhall finde their Governours and Prophets, Sollicitous and active in the firſt place, to attone God by <hi>taking up this quarrell, and controverſie, between him and his people;</hi> as in all the former Inſtances of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> they knew that as long as this breach lay open, there was no ſafety; floods of wrath and vengeance, might break in upon them at unaware; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they labour in the firſt place to repair this breach, giving us thereby to underſtand, That <hi>Violation</hi> of <hi>Covenant</hi> is a quarrell of ſuch an high nature, as there is no ſafe ſleeping under it, no not for a night.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it his honor to keep his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> Among all the excellencies and perfections that are in God.

And ſo they do, It is one of the high and glorious titles that <hi>Daniel</hi> aſcribes to God in his Prayers: <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.4 <hi>O Lord, the great and dreadfull God, keeping Covenant, and Mercy, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 105 8. <hi>He hath remembred his Covenant for ever.

                     </gap>s Covenant for ever, holy, and reverend is his Name.</hi> Now ſurely, That Excellency which God doth ſo admire and magnifie in himſelf; the contrary thereof, his ſoul doth moſt of all, hate, or abhorre, in a people, or perſon; we

               <p>And if the externall ſolemnitie adde ſo much aggravation to this ſinne, then how much more doth that inward <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of it, heap up guilt upon their heads that are found to be prophaners and violators of ſo ſolemn an Ordinance.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Aggravation of this ſin, ariſeth from the <hi>Mattor</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Covenants betwixt man and man, are in things <hi>appertaining to man;</hi> The Covenant betwixt God and man, <hi>is in things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining unto God;</hi> which as it doth exceedingly heighten the duty, ſo it doth highly aggravate the violation. It was the honour of the Prieſts under the Law, above other men, That they were ordained <hi>for men in things appertaining unto God, Heb.</hi> 5.2. And it was the honour of Chriſt above all other Prieſts, that his Prieſthood was imployed about matters of an higher nature, then the Prieſthood of the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>He hath obtained a more excellent Ministry, by how much alſo he is the Mediatour of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now conſider then I beſeech you, how excellent that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> muſt be above all others; the matter whereof gave excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to the very Prieſthood of Chriſt himſelf, and lifted it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Prieſthoods: For as the Apoſtle reaſons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> That <hi>Melchiſideck</hi> was greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he <hi>bleſſed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb</hi> 7.7. <hi>For without question, the leſſer is bleſſed of the better.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:125741:11"/>
               <p>So may I in ſome ſence argue the excellency of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant above the Prieſthood of Chriſt, in as much as this Covenant gives excellency to this Prieſthood.
<q>— <hi>He hath obtained a more excellent Priesthood, by how much he is Mediator of a better Covenant.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly the <hi>excellency of the matter</hi> is a tranſcendent <hi>aggravation</hi> of the violation of the Covenant, for men to triſſle and prevaricate in things of ſuch high concernment, in things ſo immediately appertaining to God, muſt needs be a buſineſſe of an higher provocation, then the ſonnes of men do ordinarily dream of. The Apoſtle reaſons ſtrongly and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in this very caſe:
<q>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died without mercy; Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath counted the blood of the Covenant, an unholy thing, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Covenant</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of it; the <hi>priviledge</hi> and the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,</hi> are both trampled under feet in ſome degree or other, by <hi>Covenant-prophanation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A third reaſon, why <hi>Covenant-prophanation</hi> is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo high a quarrell, is taken from the <hi>Forme</hi> of it, which is, an <hi>Oath,</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> on <hi>both ſides.</hi> The <hi>Creature</hi> ſwears <hi>by God,</hi> and God ſwears <hi>by himſelf:</hi> This is the <hi>Forme</hi> or <hi>Seal</hi> of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, between men and men.

               <p>Somewhat muſt be done <hi>de futuro;</hi> For time to come: That may not onely compoſe the Quarrell, but lay a ſure foundation of an <hi>After Peace</hi> between God and the Kingdom. And for that purpoſe, a Means lies before us; an Opportunity is held forth unto us by the hand of Divine Wiſdom, and goodneſſe, of known <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> among the People of God in former times; which is yet to me a gratious intimation, and a farther argument of hope from Heaven, that God hath not <hi>ſworn</hi> againſt us in his <hi>wrath,</hi> nor ſealed us up a People devoted to deſtruction, but hath yet a minde to enter into terms of peace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with us, to receive us into Grace and Favour, to become our God, and to own us for his People; if yet, we will go forth to meet him, and accept of ſuch honourable termes as ſhall be propounded to us. And that is by <hi>renewing our Covenant</hi> with him; yea, by entring into a more <hi>full</hi> and firme <hi>Covenant</hi> then ever heretofore: For as the Quarrell was raiſed about the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> ſo it muſt be a <hi>Covenant</hi> more ſolid and ſubſtantiall, that muſt compoſe the Quarrell, as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter, and that is the <hi>ſervice</hi> and the <hi>priviledge</hi> that lies before us; the work of the next day.

                  <p>And the firſt Motive that may engage us hereunto, is the Conſideration, how exceedingly <hi>God hath been diſhonoured</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; <hi>by all ſorts of Covenant-violation,</hi> as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcovered at large; in the <hi>avenging</hi> whereof, the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> ſtands, as once at the door of Paradice, with a flaming ſword in his hand, ready to cut us off, and caſt us out of this <hi>Garden of God;</hi> this good Land wherein he hath planted us thus long.

                  <p>Yea, Secondly,
<note place="margin">Second Motive, That ſuch a means of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is yet left us.</note> A wonderfull mercy and an high favour may we count it from our God, That yet ſuch a Soveraign means is left us for our recovery and reconciliation; Infinite condeſcention and goodneſſe it is in our God, That after ſo many fearfull provocations by our unhallowed and treacherous dealing in the Covenant he will vouchſafe, yet to have any thing to do with us, That he will yet <hi>truſt</hi> or <hi>try</hi> us any more by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to renew our Covenant with His Majeſty, when he might in juſtice rather ſay unto us, as to the wicked.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, had man broke with us, as oft as we have broke with God, we ſhould never truſt them any more, but account them as the <hi>off-ſcouring</hi> of mankinde, the vileſt, the baſeſt that ever trod upon Gods ground; and yet that after ſo
